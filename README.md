‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Classification

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using multiple machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to evaluate and compare several models ‚Äî including Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest ‚Äî and identify the most effective one based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

üìÅ Dataset

Source: heart.csv

Target variable: HeartDisease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Total records: 918

Features:Includes clinical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting BP, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and ST slope.

üõ† Tools and Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, GridSearchCV)

StandardScaler

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC

üîß Preprocessing

Handled missing values and duplicates

LabelEncoded categorical features

Standardized numerical features (for LR, KNN, NB)

Train-Test Split: 70% training, 30% testing

üìà Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

* Confusion Matrix

* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

* ROC Curve

* AUC (Area Under Curve)
 
* ROC-AUC curve analysis showed KNN had the highest separability, followed closely by Random Forest.

‚úÖ Final Recommendation

Best Performing Model: ‚úÖ KNN (Highest Accuracy & AUC)

Alternative for Scalability: üîÄ Random Forest

Interpretable Baseline: ‚ÑπÔ∏è Logistic Regression


Fast Lightweight Model: ‚ö° Naive Bayes

üß† Future Work

Add SHAP/LIME explainability

Include Support Vector Machine and XGBoost

Deploy best model using Streamlit or Flask

Add cross-validation ROC/AUC plots
