❤️ Heart Disease Classification

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using multiple machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to evaluate and compare several models — including Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest — and identify the most effective one based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

📁 Dataset

Source: heart.csv

Target variable: HeartDisease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Total records: 918

Features:Includes clinical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting BP, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and ST slope.

🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, GridSearchCV)

StandardScaler

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC

🔧 Preprocessing

Handled missing values and duplicates

LabelEncoded categorical features

Standardized numerical features (for LR, KNN, NB)

Train-Test Split: 70% training, 30% testing

📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

* Confusion Matrix

* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

* ROC Curve

* AUC (Area Under Curve)
 
* ROC-AUC curve analysis showed KNN had the highest separability, followed closely by Random Forest.

✅ Final Recommendation

Best Performing Model: ✅ KNN (Highest Accuracy & AUC)

Alternative for Scalability: 🔀 Random Forest

Interpretable Baseline: ℹ️ Logistic Regression


Fast Lightweight Model: ⚡ Naive Bayes
